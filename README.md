### An online movie ticketing system allowing users to buy, refund or edit their online booked movie tickets written in C++11


### Problem Statement

 Movie industry have been loved by myriads of people. Many people will normally purchase their movie tickets in cinema counter -offline- and directly head into watch movie. However, in many walk-in cases, there are high chance of customers missing their movie tickets on desired time due to sold out or even because they arrived late (with unexpected reasons). 
 
For many people, it would be really convenient if they can buy or refund movie tickets through online. This system will provide an easy pathway of buying movie tickets for the customers. As well as analyzing the most-famous movie by analysing the number of tickets sold out. Hence giving recommendation to the future users until the specific movie stops screening.
